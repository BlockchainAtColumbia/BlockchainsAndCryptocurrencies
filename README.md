# Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies 

B@C will facilitate a free non-credit course titled Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies. The lectures will be twice a week and ran by B@C officers, guest speakers, and Columbia faculty members. The curriculum of the course will provide an overview of cryptography, consensus mechanisms, Bitcoin mining and attacks, simplified payment verification, wallet security, hard/soft forks, smart contracts, decentralized applications, token economics, “fat-layer” protocols, zero-knowledge proofs, privacy chains, side-chains, regulatory concerns, and impact on environment/society (depending on the progression of the course). It will consist of readings from the textbooks Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies: A Comprehensive Introduction by Narayanan, Bonneau, Felten, Miller and Goldfeder, Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies by Andreas Antonopoulos, as well as several white papers and research papers. There will be problem sets and exams of sorts.
